Updated Website Map

Based on what you already have (hero section, register interest form), and the additional sections you’ve described, here’s a ready-to-use website map with actionable suggestions for further development:

1. Landing Page (/)

Purpose: Grab attention, communicate the mission, and funnel users into registering interest.

Sections:
	1.	Hero Section (Completed):
	•	Headline: “Redefining Health Through Predictive Intelligence.”
	•	Subheadline: “Join us in building a smarter future for proactive healthcare.”
	•	Buttons:
	•	“Register Interest” → Links to the form.
	•	“Learn More” → Scrolls to the About section.
	2.	How It Works (Optional for now):
	•	Brief overview with icons or visuals showing the flow:
	•	Input → AI Analysis → Recommendations → Prevent & Connect.
	3.	Key Features (Preview or Placeholder):
	•	Highlight the capabilities: AI Symptom Checker, Predictive Analytics, Data Security, Preventive Health, etc.
	4.	CTA Section (Repeating “Register Interest”):
	•	Encourage users to register.

2. About Page (/about)

Purpose: Share your vision and story to build trust and credibility.

Content Ideas:
	1.	Mission Statement:
	•	“Our mission is to empower individuals with proactive, evidence-based health intelligence.”
	2.	Vision:
	•	“Imagine a world where health isn’t reactive but predictive. Where everyone has the tools to live better, longer lives.”
	3.	About the Foundation:
	•	Briefly explain the 111 model:
	•	“1% equity, 1% revenue, and 1% of time to give back through initiatives like community health screenings and education.”
	•	Include community-driven goals (e.g., free imaging services, testing in underserved areas).
	4.	Team Vision:
	•	Add a paragraph about building a team of forward-thinkers (“mad scientists” like you and Fred).

3. Blog (/blog)

Purpose: Showcase thought leadership and build engagement.

Structure:
	1.	Blog Posts Preview (3-4):
	•	Create placeholder posts:
	•	“The Future of Predictive Healthcare”.
	•	“Why Evidence-Based Medicine Matters”.
	•	“How AI Is Transforming Health Insights”.
	2.	Blog Post Page:
	•	Each blog post should have a simple design with space for:
	•	Title, Author, Date.
	•	Content body with headings and images (if needed).

4. Careers Page (/careers)

Purpose: Attract like-minded people to your vision.

Content Ideas:
	1.	Introductory Paragraph:

	2.	General Submission Form:
	•	Name, Email, LinkedIn Profile, Resume Upload.
	3.	Future Job Postings Placeholder:
	•	“No open roles currently, but keep an eye out for updates!”

5. Register Interest Page (/register-interest)

Purpose: Already functioning, but ensure data is captured properly.

Next Steps:
	1.	Backend Setup:
	•	Use Supabase or another database to capture submitted emails and details.
	2.	Confirmation Message:
	•	Show a thank-you message after submission:
	•	“Thank you for your interest! We’ll keep you updated.”

6. Contact Page (/contact)

Purpose: A central place for inquiries.

Content Ideas:
	1.	Form Fields:
	•	Name, Email, Subject, Message.
	2.	Direct Links:
	•	Add an email address for press or partnership inquiries.
	•	Optional: Include social media links in the footer.

Additional Notes:
	•	Visual Consistency: The hero section looks sleek, so keep the minimalist black/purple theme across all pages.
	•	Development Priorities:
	1.	Finalize Register Interest backend.
	2.	Build About and Blog pages (use placeholders if needed).
	3.	Add Careers and Contact pages.
	•	Navigation: Ensure the top navbar includes:
