# Recommended Fonts & Refinements for the “Althea” Brand Wordmark

Below is a single `.md` file containing a comprehensive set of font recommendations and design adjustments for your Althea website and wordmark, building on your original concept of a stylized Greek λ (lambda) plus “ALTHEA” text.

## 1. Overall Brand Vibe

Your existing notes suggest combining a **modern, tech-forward** aesthetic with a **subtle Greek flair**, reflecting Althea’s healthcare/medical intelligence focus while nodding to Greek heritage. The stylized λ already hints at Greek roots, so the font choice for the word “ALTHEA” (and sub-brand text) should reinforce this, but **not** be so overtly decorative that it compromises legibility or modern appeal.

## 2. Font Direction & Options

### (a) Primary Wordmark Font

- **Geometric Sans‐Serif**  
  - Something with clean, open shapes reminiscent of Greek geometry.  
  - *Examples*: [**Poppins**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins), [**Figtree**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree), or [**Sofia Pro**](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro).  
  - **Why**: These have a strong, contemporary look, easy to read, and can incorporate subtle geometric forms that echo the λ’s shape.

- **Slightly Greek‐Inspired Typeface**  
  - If you want more direct ties to Greek typography, consider a **Didone** style (like [**GFS Didot**](https://www.greekfontsociety.gr/typefaces) or [**GFS Porson**](https://www.greekfontsociety.gr/typefaces)). These are historically used for Greek text, but might be too classical if you’re aiming for a modern brand.  
  - Alternatively, a **sans with Greek support** (like [**Noto Sans Greek**](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Greek)) if your brand also does Greek text.

Overall, a good rule of thumb: **aim for a simplified, modern typeface** that quietly suggests Greek geometry rather than an overt “Greek letters” display font, which can feel gimmicky.

### (b) Supporting Text & UI Font

For **body text**, sub-headings, etc., you’ll want a versatile, highly legible font that pairs well with your main wordmark:

- **Inter** (free, widely used, great for digital interfaces)  
- **IBM Plex Sans** (open source, neutral yet modern)  
- **Figtree** or **Work Sans** (to maintain a consistent geometric style if you used a geometric sans for the wordmark).

**Pairing**: If your main brand font is geometric (Poppins, Sofia Pro, etc.), choose a body typeface in a similar family or at least with a compatible x-height. This ensures a cohesive look across headings, paragraphs, and UI labels.

## 3. Lambda & “ALTHEA” Lockup Considerations

1. **Lambda Proportions**  
   - Try matching the λ’s stroke weight to the thickness of the letters in your chosen font (especially the “A” or the vertical stems in “T”/“H”). This synergy makes the entire wordmark look more unified.

2. **Spacing & Alignment**  
   - If the λ sits above the word “ALTHEA,” leave enough vertical padding so they’re clearly separated but still grouped visually.  
   - In a horizontal lockup (λ to the left, “ALTHEA” to the right), keep consistent “margins” around the symbol so it doesn’t crowd the text.

3. **Case Decision**  
   - Decide whether “ALTHEA” is uppercase vs. mixed case. Uppercase is bold and ceremonial (with Greek undertones). Title or sentence case can feel more approachable. Usually, uppercase “ALTHEA” pairs well with a stylized uppercase λ.

## 4. Color & Contrast

1. **Healthcare Colors**  
   - Typically you see **blues, teals, greens** for trust and calm. Alternatively, a sophisticated grayscale or charcoal might amplify the “modern intelligence” aspect, then a single accent color for emphasis.  

2. **Contrast & Accessibility**  
   - If your brand frequently uses black backgrounds or dark hero sections, ensure your main type color stands out. A neutral light gray or pure white for text is standard.  
   - The λ could have a subtle color accent if you want it to stand out from the rest of the wordmark.

---

## 5. Digital & Print Scalability

- **Vector Format**: Create the λ + text as an SVG or vector logo. This ensures it’s crisp at any size.  
- **Favicon / App Icon**: Simplify to just the λ or a minimal monogram (e.g., λ with a small “A”?). Don’t try to cram the entire word “ALTHEA” into tiny icons.  
- **Thin vs. Bold**: If you choose a thinner style, double-check that it remains visible and distinct on dark backgrounds, especially at smaller sizes.

---

## 6. Putting It Into Practice

1. **Hero Headline**: Use your chosen brand font for big hero statements. Large, bold, and with enough whitespace.  
2. **Body Copy**: Switch to a well-paired text typeface (Inter, Work Sans, etc.) for paragraphs.  
3. **Consistent Sizing**: Use a clear typography scale (e.g., 1.125, 1.25, 1.333 multipliers) so headings, subheads, and paragraphs form a harmonious system.  
4. **Testing**: Always do a final pass with real content, ensuring no letter-spacing or line-height issues.

## 7. Sample Font Pairings

- **Option A**  
  - **Wordmark**: [Poppins (SemiBold)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)  
  - **Body/UI**: [Inter (Regular)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)  
  - *Outcome*: Crisp, modern, geometric synergy.

- **Option B**  
  - **Wordmark**: [Sofia Pro (Bold)](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mostardesign/sofia-pro/)  
  - **Body/UI**: [IBM Plex Sans (Regular)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans)  
  - *Outcome*: A bit friendlier, with good legibility in UI contexts.

- **Option C**  
  - **Wordmark**: [GFS Didot](https://www.greekfontsociety.gr/typefaces) (for an elegant, Greek Didone style)  
  - **Body/UI**: [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans)  
  - *Outcome*: More classical vibe, though slightly less “techy.” Perfect if you want a subtle academic/Greek nod.

## 8. Summary / Next Steps

1. **Choose a modern, geometric or Greek-inspired font** for the ALTHEA wordmark that harmonizes with your stylized λ.  
2. **Pair that** with a simpler, high-legibility sans‐serif (like Inter or IBM Plex) for body text.  
3. **Refine stroke thickness** of the λ to match letterforms for a cohesive brand identity.  
4. **Test** the final mark in real contexts (on a website header, small icons, printed business cards) to confirm it remains clear.  

Once you finalize fonts, color palette, and your λ’s shape, you’ll have a consistent, professional brand system. This approach upholds the **medical intelligence + subtle Greek heritage** theme you’re aiming for, with modern design sensibilities to convey credibility and innovation.
