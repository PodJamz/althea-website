Usage Notes
	1.	Placement: Create a folder named dr-phil-goglia-summary or similar under your Next.js App Router structure (e.g., app/(marketing)/components/dr-phil-goglia-summary), and place this file inside it.
	2.	Import and Render: In any Next.js server page (page.tsx), you can import and render this component:

// app/(marketing)/page.tsx
import { DrPhilGogliaSummary } from "./components/dr-phil-goglia-summary"

export default function MarketingPage() {
  return (
    <main className="p-4">
      <DrPhilGogliaSummary />
    </main>
  )
}


	3.	Styling: Tailwind classes are added for spacing and typography. Ensure you have Tailwind and Shadcn UI (or your chosen Radix-based component library) properly configured.
	4.	Server Component: This component does not include use client, making it a React Server Component that can be rendered on the server side for optimal performance.

Below are a few subtle ways you could weave Dr. Phil Goglia’s personalized approach to nutrition into your platform—particularly in a preventative health care feature. These suggestions aim to stay true to Goglia’s emphasis on metabolic individuality, while avoiding the “one-size-fits-all” mentality often seen in generic diet platforms.

1. Personalized Meal Plan Recommendations
	•	Metabolic Assessment: Prompt users with a short questionnaire to gauge their lifestyle, body composition goals, and stress levels. Use this data to serve up meal recommendations that mimic Goglia’s individualized approach.
	•	Focus on Whole Foods: Curate meal plans that prioritize fruits, vegetables, lean proteins (organic poultry, high-fat fish), and simple carbs.
	•	Dynamic Adjustments: Encourage micro-adjustments to meal plans if users report plateauing or sudden weight changes, echoing Goglia’s “breaking through plateaus” technique.

Implementation Tip:
Create a small server component that surfaces daily meal plan suggestions based on user input. Here’s a simplified example:

// app/(features)/components/preventative-health-nutrition.tsx

import { FC } from "react"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

interface UserProfile {
  name: string
  metabolicType: string
  dietaryPreferences: string[]
  // Additional fields as needed
}

interface MealPlan {
  title: string
  meals: string[]
}

function generateMealPlan(user: UserProfile): MealPlan {
  // Replace with your real logic, factoring in metabolicType, preferences, etc.
  return {
    title: `${user.name}'s Meal Plan`,
    meals: [
      "Breakfast: Oatmeal with Berries",
      "Lunch: Salmon Salad with Leafy Greens",
      "Snack: Handful of Mixed Nuts",
      "Dinner: Roasted Chicken & Veggies",
    ],
  }
}

export function PreventativeHealthNutritionFeature({
  userProfile,
}: {
  userProfile: UserProfile
}): JSX.Element {
  const mealPlan = generateMealPlan(userProfile)

  return (
    <Card className="mt-4">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{mealPlan.title}</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>
          Personalized nutrition plan based on your metabolic needs
        </CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>

      <CardContent>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          {mealPlan.meals.map((meal, idx) => (
            <li key={idx}>{meal}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}

This simple example outlines how to generate and display a personalized meal plan. You could expand the generateMealPlan function to reflect Goglia’s methodology (metabolic type assessment, emphasis on nutrient-dense whole foods, etc.).

2. Weekly Progress and Counseling Module
	•	Check-In Feature: Similar to Goglia’s weekly counseling sessions, add a “Weekly Progress” modal or form. Let users reflect on their challenges, injuries, sleep, and stress levels.
	•	Automated Adjustments: Automatically tweak meal plans based on the user’s weekly feedback (e.g., more frequent meals if energy dips, extra protein if muscle soreness is high).

Implementation Tip:
Add a simple server action to process weekly feedback and store adjustments in the database. Surface gentle prompts in the UI, like “Based on your stress level, we’ve updated your snack recommendations.”

3. Lifestyle and Stress Integration
	•	Stress & Metabolism: A short highlight or “info card” on how stress impacts metabolism can educate users without overwhelming them.
	•	Micro-Surveys: Prompt quick user feedback (like a 1–5 rating) on stress levels or sleep quality. Factor these into meal plan adjustments.

Implementation Tip:
Use a small client component with minimal state to capture this feedback, then process it on the server for the next plan update.

4. Educational Content (Subtle Emphasis on Whole Foods)
	•	Contextual Tooltips: Whenever you list meal items, add a tooltip or note explaining the nutritional benefits (e.g., “Wild-caught salmon is rich in omega-3s, beneficial for metabolism”).
	•	Short Articles: Write quick reads on Goglia’s points—like “Why organic poultry can be beneficial” or “Understanding single-ingredient carbs”—to gently reinforce his philosophy.

5. Ongoing Adaptation and “Plateau Busters”
	•	Adaptive Algorithm: Monitor user progress, and if they hit a weight or performance plateau, automatically serve an alternative meal plan or macros ratio.
	•	Encourage Variety: Shuffle recommended meals every couple of weeks to keep the routine fresh—aligning with Goglia’s idea of continuous metabolic challenge.

Why This Matters

Dr. Goglia’s hallmark is tailoring nutrition to match an individual’s metabolic needs, rather than pushing a rigid, generic diet. Even if you include just a small subset of these ideas—like a simple “custom meal plan generator” or “weekly feedback + plan adjustment” system—it can help differentiate your platform and give users a sense of continuous, personalized care.

Key Takeaways:
	•	Personalize whenever possible, using user input on metabolic type, stress, and exercise.
	•	Keep meal plans flexible, leaning on whole, nutrient-dense foods.
	•	Provide regular check-ins or quick “counseling” features to mimic Goglia’s weekly sessions.
	•	Subtlety is best: short educational callouts or simple tooltips work well to reinforce the philosophy without overwhelming users.

By weaving these elements into your preventative healthcare feature, you reflect Dr. Goglia’s emphasis on individualized, metabolically mindful nutrition—keeping it user-friendly and approachable.
